    "## Abstract vs Interface in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes define methods that must be implemented in any subclass derived from the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class in Python is similar to an interface, but they are not exactly the same. While both define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, abstract classes in Python can also have concrete methods (methods with implementations), whereas interfaces (as they are in other languages like Java) typically cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences between Abstract Class and Interface:\n",
    "1. Concrete Methods:\n",
    "   1. Abstract Class: Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).\n",
    "   2. Interface: In many languages, interfaces can only have method signatures (i.e., abstract methods) without any implementation\n",
    "   3. However, Python does not have a strict \"interface\" type like Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance:\n",
    "   1. Abstract Class: A class can only inherit from one abstract class (since Python supports single inheritance from concrete classes, but allows multiple inheritance with abstract classes).\n",
    "   2. Interface: Typically, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of behavior. Python allow for multiple inheritance, but there is no strict \"interface\" concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fields/Attributes:\n",
    "   1. Abstract Class: Can have attributes (fields) and methods, both abstract and concrete.\n",
    "   2. Interface: In most languages, interfaces only define methods, and they do not have attributes or properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Instantiation:\n",
    "   1. Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated directly, but can have a mix of abstract and implemented methods.\n",
    "   2. Interface: Cannot be instantiated directly and typically only contains abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use in Python:\n",
    "   1. In Python, the concept of an interface is often implemented using abstract base classes (ABC), which can mimic interface-like behavior. But technically, there's no formal keyword like interface in Python. Instead, abstract classes are used to achieve the same goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Abstract class \n",
    "   1. Can have implementation. \n",
    "   2. Mainly **generalize** behavior\n",
    "   3. Cannot be initiated\n",
    "7. Interface \n",
    "   1. Cannot have implementation. \n",
    "   2. Mainly to **standardize** behavior.\n",
    "   3. Signature"

    "Yes, Python **supports multiple inheritance** of **regular (concrete) classes**. This means that a class in Python can inherit from multiple classes, whether they are abstract or concrete. When inheriting from multiple classes, Python follows the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to determine which class’s method gets called if there are conflicting method names.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Feature                       | **Python** | **Java** |\n",
    "|-------------------------------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of Concrete Classes** | **Yes**. Python allows multiple inheritance of concrete classes. The **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** is used to resolve conflicts. | **No**. Java does not allow multiple inheritance of concrete classes. A class can only extend one concrete (or abstract) class. |\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of Abstract Classes** | **Yes**. Python allows multiple inheritance of abstract classes, just like regular classes. | **No**. Java does not allow a class to inherit from multiple abstract classes. A class can only extend one abstract class. |\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of Interfaces** | **N/A**. Python does not have a formal interface concept but can mimic interfaces using abstract classes. Multiple inheritance with abstract base classes can achieve similar results. | **Yes**. Java allows multiple inheritance of interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit multiple sets of behaviors. |\n",
    "| **Inheritance of Concrete + Abstract Classes** | **Yes**. Python allows a class to inherit from a combination of both concrete and abstract classes. | **No**. In Java, a class can only extend one concrete or abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces to simulate similar behavior. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Python** supports full multiple inheritance for concrete and abstract classes alike.\n",
    "- **Java** restricts multiple inheritance for classes (both concrete and abstract) but allows it for interfaces, offering a way to implement multiple behaviors without creating ambiguity in the method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multiple inheritance is more flexible, while Java prevents it in order to avoid potential issues like the **Diamond Problem** and instead promotes interfaces as a cleaner solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Multiple Inheritance (with regular classes):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define two parent classes\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        return \"Engine started\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Wheels:\n",
    "    def roll(self):\n",
    "        return \"Wheels are rolling\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a class that inherits from both Engine and Wheels\n",
    "class Car(Engine, Wheels):\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        return \"Car is driving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of Car\n",
    "my_car = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access methods from both parent classes\n",
    "print(my_car.start())  # Output: Engine started\n",
    "print(my_car.roll())   # Output: Wheels are rolling\n",
    "print(my_car.drive())  # Output: Car is driving\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `Car` class inherits from both `Engine` and `Wheels`, which are regular classes (not abstract).\n",
    "- `Car` has access to the methods of both `Engine` (`start`) and `Wheels` (`roll`), as well as its own method `drive`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of multiple inheritance, Python uses the **C3 linearization algorithm** to determine the order in which parent classes are searched for methods. You can inspect the **MRO** using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Car.mro())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will show the order in which Python looks for methods in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Multiple Inheritance with Method Conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "If both parent classes have methods with the same name, Python will use the **MRO** to decide which method to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A, B):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "c = C()\n",
    "print(c.say_hello())  # Output: Hello from A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- Class `C` inherits from both `A` and `B`.\n",
    "- Both `A` and `B` have a `say_hello` method.\n",
    "- When `c.say_hello()` is called, Python uses the MRO and finds `say_hello` in `A` first, so it calls `A`’s method.\n",
    "- You can check the MRO using `C.mro()`, which would show `[C, A, B, object]`, indicating the order of lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Python **supports multiple inheritance** with both regular (concrete) classes and abstract classes.\n",
    "- The **MRO** ensures that Python resolves method calls in a consistent and predictable way, even when there are conflicts between parent classes.\n"
