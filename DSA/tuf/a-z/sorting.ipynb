    "1. [Selection Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/selection-sort)\n",
    "   1. Steps\n",
    "      1. Take min val of array and place it at the first\n",
    "      2. Replace the value at first to the place of min value\n",
    "      3. Select rest of the array\n",
    "      4. Repeat steps\n",
    "   2. The best,worst time complexity is O(n2)\n",
    "2. [Bubble Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bubble-sort)\n",
    "   1. Is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.\n",
    "   2. Same as selection sort, but pushes the max to the last by adjacent swaps\n",
    "   3. The best and worst time complexity is O(n) and O(n2)\n",
    "3. [Insertion Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/insertion-sort)\n",
    "   1. Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.\n",
    "   2. Takes an element and places in its correct place.\n",
    "   3. The best and worst time complexity is O(n) and O(n2)"
